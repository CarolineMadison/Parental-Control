As a mother of four, I've grown sick and tired of the YouTube dance with children who want to enjoy the site for its entertainment and informational purposes, but are exposed to streaming content that I do not approve of them watching. My youngest son, for example, is an avid Lego builder who enjoys getting ideas from his favorite YouTubers. He also enjoys searching for Minecraft gaming strategies. At seven-years-old, he's too big for YouTube Kids, but not old enough for YouTube. I'll set restrictions and expectations and my son will follow suit, but before long, he's led astray to streaming inappropriate content. Parental Control is my solution to this problem. 

In an effort to bridge the gap between YouTube and YouTube Kids, Parental Control will give me admin access to YouTube's extensive library. A search feature will allow me to browse by topic, or channel, preview the content and, if approved, add it to Parental Control's library. Admin access will also allow me to create and maintain playlists for my child, so that he can login and access videos through a safe interface where I am in control of the content. As a signed in user, my son will be able to filter all of Parental Control's library by topic or channel, view and create playlists, and remove videos from his playlists.
