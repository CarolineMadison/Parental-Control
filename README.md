# Parental Control

As the parent of a first grader, it's a daily arguement when it comes to YouTube restrictions and my expectations with its usage. Too old for YouTube Kids, my son, who devours a wide range of videos from the history of the Titanic to Minecraft strategies, needs a place where he can safely continue to learn and explore YouTube offerings, without being exposed to the dark corners of the World Wide Web. Parental Control will solve that problem by giving me the ability to search YouTube, and then add approved channels and videos to my son's account.
